Project Description:

Welcome to Grizzly's Entertainment Equipment Rental System! Grizzly's Entertainment is a leading stage equipment business that specializes in providing rental equipment for events requiring staging, lighting, power, and sound. As the holiday season approaches in Jamaica, the managers of the company are facing challenges in efficiently scheduling their assets for various events. To address this issue, a sophisticated software solution is required to streamline the management and scheduling processes.

Features:

Client/Server Architecture: Our software is built on a robust client/server architecture. The database is hosted on the server machine, and clients communicate with the server over the network. This architecture ensures secure and efficient data management and processing.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): We have designed a user-friendly GUI using a Multi-document Interface (MDI) approach. This interface facilitates easy data entry and processing for all database tables, enhancing user experience and productivity.

Logging and Exception Handling: Logging is implemented on both the client and server sides to track system activities and ensure accountability. Additionally, comprehensive exception handling mechanisms are in place to gracefully handle errors and maintain system stability.

Database Connectivity: Our system seamlessly connects to MySQL 8 using MySQL Connector/J (JDBC) and Hibernate 5 for Object Relational Mapping. This enables efficient data retrieval, storage, and manipulation, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Version Control and Collaboration: We utilize Git or its equivalent for version control, enabling collaborative development among team members. Each group member contributes to the project via a GitHub Repository, and contributions are tracked through project history logs.

Development Tools:

IDE: Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ IDE, or NetBeans IDE (JDK 1.8 or higher)
Database Management: MySQL 8 administered with MySQL Workbench or PhpMyAdmin
Database Connectivity: MySQL Connector/J (JDBC) and Hibernate 5
Logging: Apache Log4J2 for logging and audit trails
Framework: Spring Framework for Inversion of Control (IoC)
Version Control: Git or its equivalent for version control and collaboration
